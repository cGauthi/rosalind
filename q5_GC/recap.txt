My solution was pretty brute force and ugly.

LudditeCyborg wrote this in Python 2.7.  Elegant and effective use of dictionaries and .split() to solve.  Learned about the flexibility of .split().  

dnafile = open('rosalind_gc.txt', 'r')
raw = dnafile.read()
d = {}
for seqblock in raw.split(">")[1:]:
    parts = seqblock.split("\n")
    fasta = parts[0]
    seq = ''.join(parts[1:])
    gc = 100 * ( seq.count("G") + seq.count("C") ) / float(len(seq))
    d[gc] = fasta
print d[max(d)], max(d)
